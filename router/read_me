Arp:
If packet is of type ARP - Runs Arp Handler
Arp Handler: 
First check if arp entry already in my table, if it isn't add it into the cache with insert
Check if arp_op_code is of type request, if it is, send an arp reply.
If its not a request, then we try sending the packet in the queue.
In the try_sending function, we look the destination IP. If there is a find, we send the packet. If there isn't a match, then we queue a arp request in the cache and pass it to arp request handler function.
In the arp request handler function, we broadcast an arp request to evereyone up to 5 times. If we still don't receive a reply after this, we send an ICMP of type 3 code 1 (time exceeeded) and remove the request from the queue.
